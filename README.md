### Tokenomics of Web3 infrastructure networks 

The [paper](https://github.com/1kx-network/web3infrastructure_tokenomics/blob/main/SoK%20Token%20economics%20of%20Web3%20infrastructure%20networks%20-%20Part%20I.pdf) covers the first part focused on network level rewards to incentivize the supply-side of Web3 infrastructure networks. An article format summarizing it is here: https://mirror.xyz/1kx.eth/YWTZJO853QePwPUPka1aG4HXDT6hvqKnunG7fDe06Yg

Each analysed network has a folder with more information about sources and data used for the analysis (plus some additional data beyond what is covered in the paper/article).

We will continuously update those folders as we continue the research around further aspects of tokenomics. Feel free to reach out to @KoschigRobert on Twitter for questions and comments.
